This is the final release of my calculator project. The project will follow the guidelines of the milestone document and the calcultor document given in our course materials. This calculator wil show my ability to write the code, use struct, I/O file and test the project. The project itself will ask the user to perform basic math functions. The user will be asksed to pick two numbers and perform the following operations: 

A. Addiiton 
B. Subtraction 
C. Multiplication 
D. Division 
E. D operator - This just means to round the number to the nearest whole number rather than showcasing the answer in decimal points.

In addition to this, the user will get a error messages saying "you cant divide by 0" should they pick their second number as 0. Finally, if the user does not follow the standard of operations asked by the computer, i.e not picking an operator or numbers, the computer will not be able to peform their inputs and will provide them with an "Invalid Operation" error message. Now while the user is inputing their answers and the computuer is displaying the output, i have implement the I/O code so that all the results will be document in a folder on the computer in a txt file, so that all the asnwers will be documeneted in that file that we saw on the computuer output. 

All the documents of this project will be submitted in a file, that will include pictures, testcases, design report and the code.
